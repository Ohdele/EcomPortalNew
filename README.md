# E-Commerce Platform

## Project Overview
This project is a full-stack e-commerce platform featuring user authentication, product management, shopping cart functionality, and order processing. The tech stack includes Python (Flask) for backend services, JavaScript (React) for the frontend, and Java (Spring Boot) for handling complex business logic and integrating various functionalities.

## Completed Parts

### Flask Backend
- **Project Setup**: Initialized Flask project and set up the basic structure.
- **User Authentication**: Implemented login, registration, and password management.
- **API Development**: Created basic RESTful APIs for managing products.
- **Database Initialization**: Integrated with MySQL database and initialized with sample data.

### Spring Boot Backend
- **Project Setup**: Initialized Spring Boot project and configured application properties.
- **Business Logic**: Implemented core business logic for the e-commerce platform.
- **API Endpoints**: Developed RESTful APIs for product management.

### React Frontend
- **Project Setup**: Initialized React project with basic structure and dependencies.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Maven Build Issues**:
   - Encountered issues with `pom.xml`, build failures, and surefire-reports.
   - **Solution**: Closed open files that were holding locks, which resolved the build failures and allowed for successful Maven installations and builds.

2. **File Deletion Issues**:
   - Difficulty in deleting some files necessary for the build process.
   - **Solution**: Ensured all related files and processes were properly closed before attempting deletions.

3. **Target Directory Issues**:
   - Encountered issues with the `target` directory being locked or not updating correctly during the build process.
   - **Solution**: Manually deleted the `target` directory and allowed Maven to recreate it during the next build, ensuring a clean build environment.

## Remaining Tasks

### Flask Backend
- **Complete RESTful APIs**: Develop remaining APIs for order management.
- **JWT-Based Authentication**: Implement JWT for secure API access.

### Spring Boot Backend
- **Complete Development**: Finalize backend development including advanced business logic and service integration.

### React Frontend
- **Complete Setup**: Implement the full frontend including user authentication, product display, shopping cart, and order processing.
- **Integration**: Connect React frontend with Flask and Spring Boot backends.

### Integration, Testing, and Deployment
- **Integration**: Ensure seamless communication between frontend and backend services.
- **Testing**: Perform unit, integration, and user acceptance testing.
- **Deployment**: Set up CI/CD pipelines, containerize the application, and deploy to a cloud platform.
